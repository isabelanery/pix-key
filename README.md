# Pix Key

## About 
This code was developed for the technical challenge of __*Husky Academy for Devs*__'s selection process. The tests were designed to evaluate the following attributes: clarity, quality and efficiency of the code. It was my first time programming with Ruby and I was just 2 points below the cutoff.

The goal was to implement an object capable of representing a PIX key, according to [DICT API](https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/estabilidadefinanceira/pix/API-DICT.html#tag/Key)'s different keys.
